Documentation 
----------------------

This section contains the full manual and web page as displayed on
the web. To generate the full web page, including
the example gallery (this might take a while):

    make html

Or, if you'd rather not build the example gallery:

    make html-noplot

That should create all the doc in directory _build/html

To build the PDF manual, run

    make latexpdf
